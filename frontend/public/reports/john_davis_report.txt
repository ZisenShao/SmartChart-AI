Clinical Evaluation Report
Patient: John Davis
 Date of Service: 09/30/2024
 Provider: Jane Smith, MD, FACC
 Department: Cardiology
Chief Complaint
Patient presents with intermittent episodes of substernal chest discomfort associated with physical exertion.
History of Present Illness
64-year-old male with known coronary artery disease presents for routine follow-up and management of stable angina pectoris. Patient reports experiencing intermittent episodes of retrosternal pressure during moderate physical exertion, rated 4/10 on pain scale, alleviating with rest within 5-7 minutes. Denies radiation of pain, diaphoresis, or associated autonomic symptoms. No episodes of rest angina or crescendo pattern noted.
Physical Examination
Vital Signs:
BP: 142/88 mmHg
HR: 76 bpm, regular rhythm
RR: 16/min
O2 Saturation: 98% on room air
BMI: 28.4 kg/mÂ²
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, S1 and S2 normal, no S3 or S4 gallop. Grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border. No peripheral edema.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or rales.
Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, no focal deficits.
Laboratory Findings
Total Cholesterol: 210 mg/dL
LDL: 138 mg/dL
HDL: 42 mg/dL
Triglycerides: 150 mg/dL
HbA1c: 5.8%
Troponin I: <0.04 ng/mL (negative)
BNP: 85 pg/mL
Diagnostic Studies
Exercise stress test demonstrates reversible perfusion defect in the anterolateral wall, suggestive of inducible ischemia. Ejection fraction estimated at 52%.
Assessment
Stable angina pectoris (ICD-10: I20.8)
Secondary to known coronary artery disease
Currently stable on medical management
Evidence of inducible ischemia on stress testing
Essential hypertension (ICD-10: I10)
Suboptimal control
Hyperlipidemia (ICD-10: E78.5)
Requiring ongoing statin therapy
Plan
Medications:
Continue Aspirin 81mg daily for antiplatelet prophylaxis
Continue Atorvastatin 40mg daily for hyperlipidemia
Continue Metoprolol 25mg BID for rate control
PRN Nitroglycerin 0.4mg sublingual for acute anginal episodes
Procedures:
Schedule coronary angiography for October 5, 2024, to evaluate coronary anatomy and assess for potential revascularization candidates
Lifestyle Modifications:
Strict adherence to sodium-restricted diet (<2g/day)
Implementation of DASH diet principles
Smoking cessation strongly advised
Enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation program recommended
Follow-up:
Return to clinic in 2 weeks post-angiography
Continue daily blood pressure monitoring
Maintain angina diary
Educational Points
Patient educated on:
Recognition of unstable anginal symptoms requiring immediate medical attention
Proper technique for sublingual nitroglycerin administration
Importance of medication compliance
Cardiac risk factor modification strategies
Warning signs requiring emergency evaluation
